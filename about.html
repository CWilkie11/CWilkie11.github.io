                <p>
                    Hello! I am Coltan Wilkie, and I'm currently exploring the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence through the CAH 205 course. This newsletter serves as a dedicated space to document my 8-week journey into how AI is reshaping modern industries.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I am a lifelong athlete with a deep-rooted passion for hockey and golf, which has naturally evolved into a fascination with how data and technology drive performance. Currently, I am a student in CAH 205, where I’ve dedicated my research to the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Business Operations, and Sports Performance.

                    My goal with HyperDrive AI is to explore how artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping the sports landscape. I’m interested in the behind-the-scenes evolution—from how teams identify elite talent and protect player longevity to how venues are being re-engineered to create a more seamless, data-driven environment for fans. I believe AI is moving from a 'future concept' to an essential tool that defines the modern era of athletics and business.

                    When I’m not tracking the latest in sports tech, I’m likely on the ice, at the links, or exploring the entrepreneurial side of business through my own local ventures.                </p>
