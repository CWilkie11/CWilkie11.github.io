                <h3>The News</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditional metal detectors—the kind where you have to empty your pockets and wait for a beep—are quickly becoming relics of the past. As of January 2026, Pechanga Arena San Diego has joined a growing list of nearly 100 professional sports venues, including SoFi Stadium and Crypto.com Arena, in deploying Evolv Express. This AI-based screening system allows fans to walk through security at a natural pace without stopping or removing personal items.

                <h3>The Details</h3>
                <p>
                    The system uses advanced sensor technology combined with AI trained to distinguish between everyday items (like cell phones or keys) and actual threats (like firearms or bladed weapons). The new "Gen2" units, rolling out in the 2025-2026 season, feature dual-lane systems that can screen thousands of fans per hour.

                <p>
                    When the AI detects a potential threat, it sends a real-time image to a guard's tablet, highlighting the exact location of the object on the person’s body, allowing for a surgical secondary check rather than a full pat-down for everyone.

                    <h3>Context & Perspective</h3>
                    <p>
                        Gameday operations is a balancing act between safety and "the fan experience." Nobody wants to start their night standing in a 30-minute security line. I find this technology vital because it addresses the "threshold" problem—the most vulnerable part of a stadium is often the massive crowd waiting outside the gates to get in. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using AI to speed up entry, stadiums are actually making the perimeter safer by eliminating those large outdoor crowds. It’s one of the most visible ways AI is physically changing how we enter a sports venue.
