The End of the Concession Line: "WaitTime" AI Deploys Computer Vision to Concourses

The News
 For most fans, the worst part of gameday isn't a loss—it's spending twenty minutes in line for a hot dog and missing a game-changing play. To solve this, major venues like Ohio Stadium (cap 102,780) have fully integrated "WaitTime," an AI-powered computer vision system that monitors concession flow in real-time. Unlike older systems that just counted people entering a zone, this AI distinguishes between fans walking by and those actually standing in an active queue.

The Details 
The technology uses overhead cameras and AI sensors to analyze crowd density and movement patterns anonymously. This data is then pushed directly to the stadium’s mobile app and concourse digital signage. For example, a fan in Section 104 can look at their phone and see that the pizza stand at Gate 7 has a 2-minute wait, while the one at Gate 2 is backed up for 15 minutes. Redistributing fans to "low-traffic" stands, venues are increasing concession revenue while simultaneously reducing hallway congestion.

Context & Perspective 
This is a perfect example of AI solving a "friction point" that has existed since stadiums were first built. I chose to cover this because it moves AI out of the "cool gadget" category and into a core business tool. From an operations standpoint, it’s not just about fan happiness; it’s about staffing efficiency. If the AI sees a surge at a specific gate, managers can move staff in real-time rather than guessing. It turns the stadium into a giant, living data set that reacts to how we move.
