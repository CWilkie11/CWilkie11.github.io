                <h2>The News</h2>
                <p>For the 2025-26 NHL season, the "gut feeling" of traditional scouting has been bolstered by a massive influx of automated data. Front offices have shifted from simply watching prospects to "digitizing" them. By leveraging a combination of <strong>Vision AI</strong> and <strong>Real-Time Sensor Tracking</strong>, teams are now able to identify elite traits—like puck-retention under pressure or explosive acceleration—that are often invisible to the naked eye. This shift ensures that talent evaluation is grounded in objective physics rather than just subjective observation.</p>

                <h2>The Details</h2>
                <p>Three primary technologies are driving this evolution. First is <strong>Sportlogiq</strong>, which uses advanced "Vision AI" to track player movement directly from standard broadcast feeds. It allows scouts to quantify "Spatial Control," measuring how effectively a player uses the open ice.</p>
                
                <p>On the ice, <strong>NHL EDGE</strong> (powered by SMT) provides the raw physical data. Using infrared sensors embedded in the pucks and the players' shoulder pads, the system tracks speed and puck movement 25 times per second. This gives teams "Hard Truths" on a player’s max skating speed and shot velocity.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, <strong>Wisehockey (Wisesports)</strong> provides a bridge to the international market. Their fully automated platform is the standard for European leagues, allowing North American scouts to monitor a 17-year-old in Finland with the same granular data depth they have for a player in the OHL.</p>

                <h2>Context & Perspective</h2>
                <p>I chose to cover this because, as a lifelong hockey player, I find the shift toward "objective scouting" fascinating. We often talk about a player having "hockey sense," but that has always been hard to prove. With tools like Sportlogiq and Wisehockey, we can finally put a number on that intuition. To me, the most impactful part isn't that AI is replacing the scout, but that it’s removing the travel fatigue and human bias that often leads to "missed" prospects. It levels the playing field for kids in remote leagues, ensuring that if you have the speed and the smarts, the data will find you—no matter where you're playing.</p>
